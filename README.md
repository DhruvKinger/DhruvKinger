### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me anything on Azure,Xamarian & Dotnet ðŸ˜„
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Microsoft Azure Certifications.

I am a Udacity Mentor, Tutor & Project Reviewer and a Software Engineer at ThrivePass.

While working at Udacity I mentor students enrolled in Developer for Microsoft Azure, Azure Cloud Architect, Hybrid Cloud(Nutanix), and RPA (Robotic Process Automation) Nanodegree.

I enjoy the most working at Udacity in Mentorship Role because I interact with students of diff Countries,cultures. I also conduct some sessions for them as per the requirements.

So, In all I help them grow and I also grow by reading their code and I get to know about different approaches of the students to solve the same Problem.
